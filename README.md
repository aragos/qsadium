About qsadium
===================================
qsadium is meant to help you chat your adium contacts with a few quick keystrokes. This repository contains the necessary code but you shouldn't have to build it yourself - you should be able to find the plugin in Quicksilver's plugin directory (Note [2012-12-23]: This is currently wishful thinking but should soon be fixed).

Right now the source for this plugin is pretty simple and relies on AppleScript but fulfills the basic requirement: It reads contacts from Adium, adds them to Quicksilver's catalogue of items and provides a "Chat" action that will do the "right" thing.

Building, Editing and Support
----------------------------------
This code is provided as-is, I don't have a lot of time for support. Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:aragos@gmail.com "aragos@gmail.com") and I'll try to respond - but no guarantees. There's also the Quicksilver [development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/quicksilver---development) that should be able to help out.

For building the plugin from source I recommend you take a look at the Quicksilver [plugin reference](http://projects.skurfer.com/QuicksilverPlug-inReference.mdown). You'll need some of the setup - such as building Quicksilver itself from source - but otherwise this repository should include everything required to build.
